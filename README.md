# What is beery?
beery is an app store created out of boredom and "I can do it"

beery gets programs directly from their github repositories, so I won't get sued for copyright infringement (I hope)

If you want to add your (or not so) program to beery, feel free to [make a pull request](https://github.com/Forbirdden/beery-mobile/pulls) with an updated repos.json
